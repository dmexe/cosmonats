## 🎯 Why?

Most background job libraries use Redis or Postgres — tools that were never designed for this. Think of NATS as Redis — but Redis is KV first then messaging;
NATS is messaging first, then KV. What NATS is:

- **~20 MB binary, ~10 MB RAM at idle** Trivial to run anywhere.
- **Disk-backed persistent streams** Messages survive restarts, don't require RAM to fit.
- **True horizontal clustering** Lose a node — other nodes take over, zero message loss.
- **Multilingual** Official clients for Ruby, Go, Python, Rust, Java, .NET, and more. Any service can publish or consume.

One NATS server replaces your message broker, job queue, and KV store — with lower operational overhead.

### Killer Features:

#### — Jobs + Streams, unified in one gem.

Most Ruby gems handle exactly that — background jobs. If you also need to consume a continuous event feed, that's a second system, second config, second set of
worker processes, second Dockerfile entry. Cosmonats is the only Ruby gem with a first-class `Job` primitive *and* a first-class `Stream` primitive, sharing
one server, one config, one CLI, one monitoring endpoint.

#### — Message replay and time-travel debugging.

NATS persists messages to disk and lets any consumer rewind to any point — beginning of time, a specific timestamp, or only new messages.
- **Incident recovery** — your pipeline crashed for 3 hours. Replay from the crash timestamp.
- **New consumer bootstrap** — a new service needs historical events. Start it from the beginning.
- **Bug reproduction** — replay the exact sequence of messages that caused a production issue.

#### — Multi-datacenter queues, natively.

NATS has a first-class cluster + leaf-node architecture for geo-distribution. Spanning multiple regions or datacenters is a config block — not a separate
product or a third-party replication tool. NATS was built for edge computing, IoT, and satellite communication — multi-DC is a first-class concern, not an
afterthought.

#### — Transport-level deduplication + built-in KV. No extra infrastructure.

NATS deduplicates messages at the **broker** — same-ID messages within the configured window are dropped before they ever reach a worker. No uniqueness gems,
no advisory locks, no extra round-trips. It also ships a built-in Key/Value store usable for distributed locks and rate limiting — no Redis, no Memcached,
nothing else to run.


## ✨ Features

### 🎪 Job Processing
- **Familiar API** — `perform_async`, `perform_in`, `perform_at`
- **Priority queues** — critical, high, default, low with weighted round-robin
- **Scheduled jobs** — execute at a specific time or after a delay
- **Automatic retries** — exponential backoff, configurable attempts
- **Dead letter queue** — capture permanently failed jobs
- **Job uniqueness** — prevent duplicate execution
- **Concurrency limits** — cap simultaneous executions per class or per key
- **Cron scheduling** — recurring jobs manageable live from the web UI
- **Batches** — group jobs and fire a callback once the whole group finishes, including nested batches

### 🌊 Stream Processing
- **Real-time event streams** — process continuous data feeds
- **Batch processing** — handle multiple messages in one go
- **Message replay** — reprocess from any point in time
- **Consumer groups** — load-balanced across workers
- **Custom serialization** — JSON, MessagePack, Protobuf
- **Pause / resume** — stop and restart a stream's processing without losing its position


## 📦 Installation

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "cosmonats"
```

**Requirements:** Ruby ≥ 3.1, NATS Server ([install guide](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/introduction/installation))

**Optional gems** — not installed with `cosmonats`, add them only for the features you use:

| Feature                                       | Gems              |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Monitoring UI (`Cosmo::Web`)                  | `rack`            |
| Health check HTTP server (`/health`, `/ping`) | `rack`, `webrick` |

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "rack", "~> 3.0"
gem "webrick", "~> 1.9"
```

Spin up NATS instantly with Docker — one command, that's it:
```bash
docker run -p 4222:4222 -p 8222:8222 nats:alpine -js
```

Or add it to your existing `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  nats:
    image: nats:alpine
    command: -js
    ports:
      - "4222:4222"
      - "8222:8222"
```

Mount the monitoring UI in your Rack app:
```ruby
require "cosmo/web"

# Rails
mount Cosmo::Web => "/cosmo"

# Any Rack app (config.ru)
map "/cosmo" { run Cosmo::Web }
```


## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create `config/cosmo.yml`

```yaml
concurrency: 5                     # Number of worker threads

consumers:                         # Declare consumer groups for streams, things that pull messages and process them
  jobs:                            # Consumer configs for jobs (or streams)
    default:                       # Stream name
      ack_policy: explicit         # Acknowledgment required for each message can be explicit, none, or all
      max_deliver: 30              # Max retry attempts before sending to a dead stream. Safety ceiling only, keep it above every job class's own retry
      max_ack_pending: 10          # Max messages waiting for ack, if exceeded, the server will stop delivering new messages until some are acked
      ack_wait: 15                 # Seconds to wait for ack before redelivering
      subject: jobs.%{name}.>      # Subject pattern for this consumer, %{name} replaced with stream name, becomes `jobs.default.>`

setup:                             # Initial stream creation only `cosmo -S`
  jobs:                            # Stream configs for jobs (or streams)
    default:                       # Stream name
      storage: file                # Storage type (file or memory)
      retention: workqueue         # Retention policy (limits, interest, workqueue). workqueue - deletes acked/nacked, limits - append only
      subjects: ["jobs.%{name}.>"] # Subject pattern for this stream, %{name} replaced with stream name
      allow_direct: true           # Allow direct messages to stream (required for web UI)
```

### 2. Create streams in NATS (one-time), grabs config from setup section of `config/cosmo.yml`

```bash
bundle exec cosmo -S
```

### 3. Define a job in `app/jobs/`

```ruby
class SendEmailJob
  include Cosmo::Job
  options stream: :default, retry: 3, dead: true

  def perform(user_id, email_type)
    UserMailer.send(email_type, user_id).deliver_now
  end
end
```

### 4. Enqueue & run

```ruby
SendEmailJob.perform_async(42, "welcome")
```

```bash
bundle exec cosmo -C config/cosmo.yml -c 10 -r ./app/jobs jobs
```


## 💡 Core Concepts

### Jobs

```ruby
class ReportJob
  include Cosmo::Job

  options(
    stream: :critical,  # Stream name
    retry: 5,           # Retry attempts
    dead: true          # Send to dead letter queue on final failure
  )

  def perform(report_id)
    logger.info "Processing report #{report_id}"
    Report.find(report_id).generate!
  rescue StandardError => e
    logger.error "Failed: #{e.message}"
    raise  # Triggers retry with exponential backoff
  end
end

ReportJob.perform_async(42)                              # Enqueue now
ReportJob.perform_in(30.minutes, 42)                     # Delayed
ReportJob.perform_at(Time.parse("2026-01-25 10:00"), 42) # Scheduled
ReportJob.perform_sync(42)                               # Inline, no NATS (great for tests)
```

### Streams

```ruby
class ClicksProcessor
  include Cosmo::Stream

  options(
    stream: :clickstream,
    batch_size: 100,
    start_position: :last,  # :first, :last, :new, or timestamp
    consumer: {
      ack_policy: "explicit",
      max_deliver: 3,
      max_ack_pending: 100,
      subjects: ["events.clicks.>"]
    }
  )

  # Process one message at a time
  def process_one
    Analytics.track_click(message.data)
    message.ack
  end

  # OR process a batch
  def process(messages)
    Analytics.bulk_track(messages.map(&:data))
    messages.each(&:ack)
  end
end

# Publishing
ClicksProcessor.publish({ user_id: 123, page: "/home" }, subject: "events.clicks.homepage")

# Acknowledgment strategies
message.ack                          # Success
message.nack(delay: 5_000_000_000)   # Retry in 5 seconds (nanoseconds)
message.term                         # Permanent failure, no retry
```

### Configuration

**NATS subjects** follow a dot-separated hierarchy (`events.clicks.homepage`).
The `>` wildcard matches everything after that prefix. Think of subjects as topic names — flexible routing with no extra configuration.

**Full `config/cosmo.yml` example:**
```yaml
timeout: 25                 # Shutdown timeout in seconds
concurrency: &concurrency 1 # Number of worker threads
max_retries: &max_retries 3 # Default max retries
batch_expiry: 259200         # Seconds before a Batch's tracking data expires (default: 3 days)

stream_config: &stream_config
  storage: file         # storage type (file or memory)
  retention: workqueue  # retention policy (limits, interest, workqueue)
  duplicate_window: 120 # time window for duplicate message detection in seconds
  discard: old          # what to drop when the stream is full (new rejects publishes, old evicts the oldest)
  allow_direct: true    # allow direct messages to stream, required for web UI
  subjects:
    - jobs.%{name}.>    # subject pattern for stream, %{name} will be replaced with stream name

consumer_config: &consumer_config
  ack_policy: explicit    # ack policy (explicit, none, all), each individual message must be acknowledged
  max_deliver: 30         # maximum number of times a message will be delivered before it's considered failed. keep it above every job class's own retry; a job that still exceeds it is capped and dead-lettered early with a warning
  max_ack_pending: 20     # maximum number of messages with pending ack for this consumer
  ack_wait: 60            # time in seconds to wait for an ack before redelivering the message
  subject: jobs.%{name}.> # subject pattern for consumer, %{name} will be replaced with stream name

consumers:
  jobs:
    critical:
      <<: *consumer_config
      priority: 50
    high:
      <<: *consumer_config
      priority: 30
    default:
      <<: *consumer_config
      priority: 15
    low:
      <<: *consumer_config
      priority: 5
    scheduled:
      <<: *consumer_config
      max_deliver: 5
      max_ack_pending: 100
      ack_wait: 10

setup:
  jobs:
    critical:
      <<: *stream_config
      description: Very critical priority jobs
    high:
      <<: *stream_config
      description: Higher priority jobs
    default:

      description: Lower priority jobs
    scheduled:
      <<: *stream_config
      discard: old            # required here: NATS refuses `discard: new` on the stream holding cron schedules
      description: Scheduled jobs
    dead:
      <<: *stream_config
      retention: limits
      max_msgs: 10000
      max_age: 604800 # 7d
      description: Broken jobs (DLQ)

development:
  verbose: false
  concurrency: *concurrency

staging:
  verbose: true
  concurrency: 3

production:
  concurrency: 3
```

**Programmatic:**
```ruby
Cosmo::Config.set(:concurrency, 20)
Cosmo::Config.set(:setup, :streams, :custom, { storage: "file", subjects: ["custom.>"] })
```

**Environment variables:**
```bash
export NATS_URL=nats://localhost:4222
export COSMO_JOBS_FETCH_TIMEOUT=0.1
export COSMO_STREAMS_FETCH_TIMEOUT=0.1
```


## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Cron

Recurring jobs, without a separate scheduler process. A schedule is just a message parked in the
`scheduled` stream (requires NATS Server 2.14+) — NATS fires it on the cron expression, and the
worker's scheduler dispatches the job on to the stream that runs it, the same path a delayed job
takes. Deploy it once; whatever's in NATS is exactly what runs and exactly what shows up in the web
UI's **Crons** tab, where each entry can be inspected, run immediately, or deleted.

Every schedule lives in `scheduled` because NATS only lets a schedule fire at a subject its own
stream covers, and refuses `discard: new` on any stream with scheduling enabled. Keeping schedules
in one stream leaves every stream that actually runs jobs free to choose its own discard policy.
The trade is that cron firings are dispatched by the scheduler, so at least one worker has to be
running without `--no-scheduler`.

Declare schedules right in `config/cosmo.yml`:

```yaml
setup:
  cron:
    daily_report:
      class: ReportJob
      schedule: "@daily"        # @-shortcuts are passed straight through to NATS
      stream: default
    weekday_digest:
      class: ReportJob
      schedule: "0 9 * * 1-5"   # 6-field NATS cron (seconds first); 5-field UNIX cron is auto-normalized
      stream: default
      args: ["daily"]
      timezone: America/New_York # optional, cron expressions only
```

`cosmo -C config/cosmo.yml -S` syncs it — whatever's in the file is exactly what ends up scheduled in NATS, same as streams.

Prefer to manage schedules at runtime instead? The same operations are available from Ruby:

```ruby
Cosmo::API::Cron.instance.upsert!(
  class_name: "ReportJob", stream: "default", schedule: "0 9 * * 1-5",
  args: ["daily"], timezone: "America/New_York", name: "weekday_report"
)

Cosmo::API::Cron.instance.all                                    # every schedule currently deployed
Cosmo::API::Cron.instance.run_now!("cosmo.cron.default.report_job.weekday_report")  # bypass the timer
Cosmo::API::Cron.instance.delete!("cosmo.cron.default.report_job.weekday_report")   # stop future firings
```

### Priority Queues

```ruby
class UrgentJob
  include Cosmo::Job
  options stream: :critical  # priority: 50 in config — polled most frequently
end
```

### Batches

Group jobs together and fire a callback once every one of them has finished. The registered class
is plain Ruby — it implements `on_complete(status, opts)` / `on_success(status, opts)`, not
`perform` — and runs on the job worker pool, not inline on whichever thread finalized the batch.
`status` is `{ bid:, total:, succeeded:, failed: }` and `opts` is whatever you passed to `#on`.

```ruby
batch = Cosmo::Batch.new
batch.jobs do
  ImportJob.perform_async(1)
  ImportJob.perform_async(2)
end
batch.on(:complete, NotifyUser, user_id: 1)  # fires once every job has finished, pass or fail
batch.on(:success, NotifyUser, user_id: 1)   # fires only if none of them failed

class NotifyUser
  def on_complete(status, opts)
    UserMailer.batch_done(opts[:user_id], status[:succeeded], status[:total]).deliver_later
  end

  def on_success(status, opts)
    UserMailer.batch_succeeded(opts[:user_id]).deliver_later
  end
end
```

- `#jobs` is the only place membership is tracked — jobs enqueued outside the block aren't part of
  the batch. Call it at least once (an empty block is fine) to close the batch.
- `:complete` always fires once every job is done. `:success` fires only if none were dead-lettered
  or dropped after exhausting retries. Both can be registered before or after `#jobs` — a callback
  registered after the batch has already finished still fires.

**Nested batches** — a running job can spawn its own sub-batch, which counts as one pending unit
  of its parent and propagates any failure upward as a single failure unit:

  ```ruby
  class ImportJob
    include Cosmo::Job

    def perform(account_id)
      sub_batch = Cosmo::Batch.new(parent: batch_id)  # batch_id is this job's own batch, if any
      sub_batch.jobs { SyncRecordJob.perform_async(account_id) }
    end
  end
  ```
- Batch tracking data (pending counts, callbacks, results) expires automatically after
  `Config[:batch_expiry]` seconds (default: 3 days).
- Open and finished batches — with pending/succeeded/failed counts — are listed live in the web UI's **Batches** tab.
- Only `Cosmo::Job`-based jobs are tracked; the ActiveJob adapter doesn't currently participate in
  batches (see [`docs/active_job.md`](docs/active_job.md)).

### Concurrency Limiting

```ruby
class ThirdPartyApiJob
  include Cosmo::Job
  # At most 3 instances of this job run at once, cluster-wide.
  # Jobs that lose the race are NAK'd with a delay equal to `duration`
  # so they aren't redelivered until a slot is guaranteed free.
  options limit: { duration: 30, concurrency: 3 }
end

class PerAccountSyncJob
  include Cosmo::Job
  # Scope the cap per key instead of class-wide — e.g. one concurrent sync per account.
  options limit: { duration: 30, concurrency: { to: 1, key: ->(account_id) { account_id } } }

  def perform(account_id)
    Account.find(account_id).sync!
  end
end
```

### Custom Serializers

```ruby
module MessagePackSerializer
  def self.serialize(data) = MessagePack.pack(data)
  def self.deserialize(payload) = MessagePack.unpack(payload)
end

class FastStream
  include Cosmo::Stream
  options publisher: { serializer: MessagePackSerializer }
end
```

### Error Handling

```ruby
class ResilientJob
  include Cosmo::Job
  options retry: 5, dead: true

  def perform(data)
    process_data(data)
  rescue RetryableError => e
    logger.warn "Retryable: #{e.message}"
    raise  # Will retry with exponential backoff
  rescue FatalError => e
    logger.error "Fatal: #{e.message}"
    # Don't raise — won't retry, won't go to DLQ
  end
end
```

By default, a failed job is redelivered after `attempt**4 + 15` seconds. Override that per job class
with `retry_in`, given the 1-based attempt count and the exception that was raised:
```ruby
class ThrottledApiJob
  include Cosmo::Job
  options retry: 5, retry_in: ->(count, exception) { exception.is_a?(RateLimitedError) ? 60 : count * 10 }

  def perform(...)
    # ...
  end
end
```
If the proc returns something non-numeric/non-positive, or raises, the default backoff is used
instead. Note: if this job class also sets `limit: { concurrency: ... }` (see above), `count`
includes deliveries that were turned away for lack of a free slot, not just failed attempts.

### Testing

```ruby
# Synchronous — no NATS needed
SendEmailJob.perform_sync(123, "test")

# Async — returns a job ID
jid = SendEmailJob.perform_async(123, "welcome")
assert_kind_of String, jid
```


### Integrations

**ActiveJob:**
```ruby
# config/application.rb
config.active_job.queue_adapter = :cosmonats
```
The ActiveJob queue name maps directly to a Cosmo stream. Use `cosmo_options` for anything
Cosmo-specific — retries, DLQ behavior, overriding the target stream, or a custom retry delay:
```ruby
class ReportJob < ApplicationJob
  cosmo_options retry: 5, dead: false, stream: :critical, retry_in: ->(count, exception) { count * 10 }

  def perform(report_id)
    Report.find(report_id).generate!
  end
end
```
Inside a Rails app this is wired up automatically by the bundled Railtie — it registers the
adapter and loads `config/cosmo.yml` if present. Outside Rails:
```ruby
require "cosmo/active_job"
ActiveJob::Base.queue_adapter = Cosmo::ActiveJobAdapter::Adapter.new
```

**Sentry:**
```ruby
require "cosmo/sentry/auto"
```
Wraps every job execution in a Sentry transaction (`queue.cosmonats`) and captures unhandled
exceptions with the job's id, stream, subject, and retry count attached as context — no other
setup beyond having `sentry-ruby` initialized.

```

Each selected stream gets its own durable consumer, named `consumer-<stream>`. Every process that subscribes to a stream
pulls from that same consumer, so running a dedicated fleet per stream splits the work instead of duplicating it.
The `scheduled` stream is a service stream: it is always dispatched, and naming it in `--streams` selects nothing, use
`--no-scheduler` on workers that should not dispatch scheduled jobs. Unknown stream names abort the process.

**Global flags** (before the command):

| Flag                    | Description                          | Example               |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `-C, --config PATH`     | Config file path                      | `-C config/cosmo.yml` |
| `-c, --concurrency INT` | Worker threads                        | `-c 20`               |
| `-r, --require PATH`    | Auto-require directory                | `-r ./app/jobs`       |
| `-t, --timeout NUM`     | Shutdown timeout (sec)                | `-t 60`               |
| `-S, --setup`           | Setup streams & sync cron, then exit  | `--setup`             |
| `-v, --version`         | Print version and exit                | `--version`           |
| `-h, --help`            | Show help and exit                    | `--help`               |

**`jobs` command options:**

| Flag                    | Description                                                       | Example                        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `--streams NAMES`       | Only subscribe to these job streams, instead of all configured ones | `--streams default,high`      |
| `--stream NAME`         | Same as `--streams`, for a single stream                           | `--stream default`             |
| `--[no-]scheduler`      | Dispatch scheduled jobs (default: yes)                             | `--no-scheduler`               |
| `--subject NAME`        | Job's subject                                                      | `--subject jobs.default.foo`   |

`--streams`/`--stream` also read from `COSMO_JOBS_STREAMS` (comma-separated) when neither flag is given.

**`streams` command options** (`--stream`/`--subject`/`--consumer_name`/`--batch_size` apply only when running a single processor; ignored once `--processors` selects more than one):

| Flag                     | Description                          | Example                         |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `--processors NAMES`     | Only run these stream processor classes | `--processors OrderProcessor` |
| `--stream NAME`          | Stream name                          | `--stream orders`              |
| `--subject NAME`         | Subject name                         | `--subject orders.created`     |
| `--consumer_name NAME`   | Consumer name                        | `--consumer_name orders-consumer` |
| `--batch_size NUM`       | Messages per fetch batch             | `--batch_size 50`               |


### Health check

Pass `-p/--http-port` (or set `http.port` in the config) to start a small WEBrick HTTP server alongside the workers.
It needs the optional `rack` and `webrick` gems (see [Installation](#-installation)); without a port they're never loaded.

```yaml
http:
  port: 9090
  host: 0.0.0.0 # default
```

`GET /health` returns `200` when processors are running and NATS is connected, `503` otherwise:

```bash
curl localhost:9090/health
# {"status":"ok","checks":{"engine":true,"nats":true}}
```

`GET /ping` always returns `200 pong` without checking anything, handy as a liveness probe (use `/health` for readiness):

```bash
curl localhost:9090/ping
# pong
```


## 🚢 Deployment

**NATS Cluster config:**
```bash
# nats-server.conf
port: 4222
jetstream {
  store_dir: /var/lib/nats
  max_file: 10G
}
cluster {
  name: cosmo-cluster
  listen: 0.0.0.0:6222
  routes: [nats://nats-2:6222, nats://nats-3:6222]
}
```

  nats:
    image: nats:latest
    command: -js -c /etc/nats/nats-server.conf
    volumes:
      - ./nats.conf:/etc/nats/nats-server.conf
      - nats-data:/var/lib/nats

  worker:
    build: .
    environment:
      NATS_URL: nats://nats:4222
    command: bundle exec cosmo -C config/cosmo.yml -c 20 jobs
    deploy:
      replicas: 3

## 📊 Monitoring

**Web UI** — mount `Cosmo::Web` (see [Installation](#-installation)) for a live, htmx-powered dashboard:
- **Jobs** — enqueued, scheduled, busy, and dead views, with per-job retry and delete
- **Streams** — per-stream state (messages, bytes, consumers) with pause/resume
- **Crons** — every schedule deployed in NATS, with run-now and delete
- **Batches** — open and finished batches with pending/succeeded/failed counts
- Summary counters (processed / failed / busy / enqueued / retries / scheduled / dead) backed by a NATS KV counter, no separate metrics store needed

**Structured logs:**
```
2026-01-23T10:15:30.123Z INFO pid=12345 tid=abc jid=def: start
2026-01-23T10:15:32.456Z INFO pid=12345 tid=abc jid=def elapsed=2.333: done
```

**Stream Metrics:**
```ruby
client = Cosmo::Client.instance
info = client.stream_info("default")

info.state.messages       # Total messages
info.state.bytes          # Total bytes
info.state.consumer_count # Number of consumers
```

**Prometheus** — NATS exposes metrics at `:8222/metrics`:
- `jetstream_server_store_msgs` — Messages in stream
- `jetstream_consumer_delivered_msgs` — Delivered messages
- `jetstream_consumer_ack_pending` — Pending acknowledgments


## 💼 Examples

**Email queue with scheduling:**
```ruby
class EmailJob
  include Cosmo::Job
  options stream: :default, retry: 3

  def perform(user_id, template)
    user = User.find(user_id)
    EmailService.send(user.email, template)
  end
end

EmailJob.perform_async(123, "welcome")
EmailJob.perform_in(1.day, 123, "followup")
```

**Image Processing Pipeline:**
```ruby
class ImageProcessor
  include Cosmo::Stream
  options(
    stream: :images,
    consumer: { subjects: ["images.uploaded.>"] }
  )

  def process_one
    processed = ImageService.process(message.data["url"])
    publish(processed, subject: "images.processed.optimized")
    message.ack
  rescue => e
    logger.error "Processing failed: #{e.message}"
    message.nack(delay: 30_000_000_000) # retry in 30s
  end
end

ImageProcessor.publish({ url: "https://example.com/image.jpg" }, subject: "images.uploaded.user")
```

**Real-Time Analytics:**
```ruby
class AnalyticsAggregator
  include Cosmo::Stream
  options batch_size: 1000, consumer: { subjects: ["events.*.>"] }

  def process(messages)
    aggregates = messages.map(&:data).group_by { |e| e["type"] }.transform_values(&:count)
    Analytics.bulk_insert(aggregates)
    messages.each(&:ack)
  end
end
```
